/// Synchronous, fsync-per-write logger for the Network Extension.

/// WHY this exists separately from `TURNLog` / `appendExtLog`: those
/// rely on `FileHandle.write` / `synchronize`, which Foundation
/// buffers internally. When the extension calls into gomobile
/// `SocksstubStartVKTurnUpstream` (a blocking call that can sleep up
/// to 15 seconds while VK Allocate handshakes), any log line the
/// caller emits after the block never lands on disk before the
/// extension is reaped by iOS or its log file handle goes stale.
///
/// `ExtLog` opens a fresh file descriptor on every line, writes the
/// bytes via `Darwin.write`, calls `fsync`, then closes the fd. No
/// FileHandle, no buffering, no shared state. The cost is a few
/// microseconds per line — acceptable since we only call it on
/// boundary events, not the hot data path.
///
/// File location: App Group container, filename matches the existing
/// `extension-log.txt` that `appendExtLog` writes to and that the
/// in-app `LogView` reads. Both writers append to the same file —
/// `O_APPEND` ensures atomic positioning under the kernel even when
/// two writers race.
